🚀 Step-by-Step Implementation Process
Follow these steps to ensure your project is properly configured for deployment and sharing:

Step 1: Create and Save the File
Create a new plain text file named requirements.txt.

Paste the content provided above into this file.

Crucial Location: Save this file in the root directory (the main folder) of your project, alongside your Python application script (ml.py).

Step 2: Test Locally (Optional but Recommended)
You can verify that this file works correctly by creating a brand-new virtual environment and installing packages from the file:

Deactivate your current environment (deactivate).

Delete your old environment (rm -rf .venv or delete the folder manually).

Create a new one (python -m venv testenv).

Activate the new one (source testenv/bin/activate or .\testenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1).

Install using the file:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 3: Deployment (GitHub & Streamlit Cloud)
Commit Changes: Ensure both your main script (ml.py) and the new requirements.txt file are committed and pushed to your GitHub repository.

Redeploy: On Streamlit Cloud, go to your app settings and trigger a redeploy (or simply wait if automatic deployment is enabled).

Streamlit Cloud will look for the requirements.txt file and execute the equivalent of the pip install -r requirements.txt command, resolving the ModuleNotFoundError.
